# Mixpanel MCP Skills Playground

**Workflow patterns and skills for using Mixpanel with AI coding assistants.**

This repository provides analysis and instrumentation skills for [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com) users working with AI coding assistants — **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Codex**, and other MCP-compatible clients.

## What's Inside

| Plugin                          | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [mixpanel](./plugins/mixpanel/) | Analysis, instrumentation, and data governance skills covering reports, boards, experiments, replays, taxonomy, and more |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Mixpanel MCP Server

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```bash
claude mcp add mixpanel -- npx -y @mixpanel/mcp-server
```

Complete the OAuth flow when prompted.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

Go to **Settings > Agent > Tools & MCP > Add MCP Server** and add:

```json
{
  "mixpanel": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@mixpanel/mcp-server"]
  }
}
```

Complete the OAuth flow in the browser when prompted.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex (OpenAI)</strong></summary>

Add the MCP server to your `.agents/plugins/` configuration. See the [Codex docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/codex) for MCP setup.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Other MCP Clients</strong></summary>

Any client that supports the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) can connect to `@mixpanel/mcp-server`. Refer to your client's MCP documentation.

</details>

### 2. Install Skills

**Claude Code** — copy skills to your local skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rpatel05/mcp-skills-playground.git
cp -r mcp-skills-playground/plugins/mixpanel/skills/daily-brief ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Cursor** — reference skills from `.cursor-plugin/` or copy SKILL.md files into your workspace.

**For Teams** — fork this repo and customize skills for your team's workflows and naming conventions.

### 3. Verify

```
/daily-brief
/create-report show me DAU for the last 7 days
/taxonomy
```

If a skill doesn't work:
1. Verify Mixpanel MCP server is connected (`/mcp` to check status)
2. Ensure OAuth authentication completed successfully
3. Check that the skill file exists in your skills directory

## CI / CD

Two GitHub Actions workflows keep the repo consistent:

- **Auto Version Bump** — patches plugin versions across all platform manifests when a PR touching `plugins/` is merged
- **Manifest Sync Check** — blocks PRs if `.claude-plugin`, `.cursor-plugin`, or `.codex-plugin` manifests have mismatched name, description, or version fields

---

## Contributing

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a branch for your feature
3. Follow existing patterns in `plugins/mixpanel/skills/`
4. Submit a PR — the manifest sync check will validate your changes

### Creating a New Skill

1. Create `plugins/mixpanel/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md`
2. Include frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what the skill does
---
```

3. Test the skill locally before submitting
