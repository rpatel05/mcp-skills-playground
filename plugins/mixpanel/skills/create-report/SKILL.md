# Create Mixpanel Report

Create reports from natural language by discovering events, building report queries, and verifying results.

## Planning First (Critical)

Before any tool calls, decompose the request:

**1. Identify report components:**
- Report type (Insights, Funnels, Flows, Retention, etc.)
- Time range (default: Last 30 Days if not specified)
- Primary event (the action being measured)
- Segment conditions (user filters/breakdowns)
- Filters, breakdowns, cohorts
- Funnel steps (if conversion analysis)

**2. Plan event searches:**
- ONE search per distinct event concept
- Never combine multiple concepts in one search
- Example: "purchase" and "signup" need separate searches

**3. Plan parallel tool calls:**
- Get project info, search events, find cohorts can run together
- Wait for results before building query

## Event Discovery (Critical: Discovery First)

**IMPORTANT: Cast a wide net before narrowing down**

When the user's request is ambiguous or could map to multiple events:
1. Search BROADLY first to discover relevant options
2. Review relevant results - look for related events, custom events
3. Present options to user OR explain your selection rationale
4. Try not to assume a single event is the only answer without exploration

**Search for events:**
```
Mixpanel:Get-Events or Mixpanel:Get-Event-Details
```
- Search ONE concept at a time
- Use broad search terms first (e.g., "purchase" not just "purchase completed")
- ✓ Good: "user completes purchase"
- ✗ Bad: "signup or purchase events"

**Make informed decisions, then explain:**
1. Search broadly to discover all options
2. Review results and identify the most comprehensive/accurate approach
3. Make your best judgment call
4. **Always explain**: "I found X, Y, Z options. I chose [X] because [reason]. This includes/excludes [scope]."
5. User can correct if your assumption was wrong

**Verify before use:**
- Check event has actual volume (not zero/stale)
- Get properties with Mixpanel:Get-Property-Names and Mixpanel:Get-Property-Values
- If zero results, search for alternatives

## Report Type Selection

| Report Type | Use When |
|------------|------------|
| `insights` | Counting events/users over time, trends, comparisons, KPIs, distributions, property analytics, segmentation |
| `funnels` | Multi-step conversion analysis with a **known sequence**, drop-off analysis, time between specific events |
| `flows` | Path exploration, discovering **unknown paths** users take, next-step analysis |
| `retention` | User return behavior, cohort retention curves, churn analysis |
| `formulas` | Calculated metrics, ratios, custom KPIs combining multiple events |

### Quick Reference

**insights** - Most versatile. Use for:
- User counts (DAU, WAU, MAU) with unique users
- Event totals, averages, property sums
- Trends, comparisons, distributions
- Segmentation by any property

**funnels** - Conversion analysis. Use for:
- Step-by-step conversion rates when you know the expected sequence
- Time-to-convert between events
- Exclusion events
- Conversion windows

**flows** - Path discovery. Use for:
- Understanding actual paths users take
- Next-step analysis from any event
- Discovering unexpected navigation patterns

**retention** - Return behavior. Use for:
- N-day retention
- Rolling retention
- Bracket retention
- Cohort analysis

**formulas** - Custom calculations. Use for:
- Ratios (conversion rate, revenue per user)
- Combining multiple metrics
- Custom KPIs

## Report Query Structure

**Core parameters (Insights):**
```json
{
  "from_date": "2026-03-01",
  "to_date": "2026-03-31",
  "events": [{
    "event": "Purchase Completed",
    "filters": [],
    "name": "Purchase Completed"
  }],
  "type": "general",
  "unit": "day"
}
```

**Key parameters:**
- `type`: "general" (trends), "unique" (uniques), "average" (averages)
- `unit`: "day", "week", "month", "hour"
- `events`: Array of events to query
- `where`: Global filters (apply to all events)
- `on`: Breakdown property

**Event filters:**
```json
"where": "properties[\"country\"] == \"United States\""
```

**Breakdowns:**
```json
"on": "properties[\"platform\"]"
```

## Workflow: Create Report

1. **Get project context:**
```
Mixpanel:Get-Projects (to get project_id)
```

2. **Discover events** (BROAD search first):
```
Mixpanel:Get-Events for general event list
Mixpanel:Get-Event-Details for specific event info
```

3. **Find cohorts if needed:**
```
List cohorts from Lexicon or query
```

4. **Build query** using discovered event names

5. **Build and run query**

**For simple queries** (single event, no breakdowns/filters):
```
Mixpanel:Run-Query(
  project_id=X,
  report_type='insights',
  report={
    "name": "DAU Last 7 Days",
    "metrics": [
      {
        "eventName": "$ae_session",
        "measurement": {"type": "basic", "math": "unique"}
      }
    ],
    "chartType": "line",
    "unit": "day",
    "dateRange": {"type": "relative", "range": {"unit": "day", "value": 7}}
  }
)
```

**For complex queries** (breakdowns, filters, formulas, multiple metrics):

1. **First, get the full schema:**
   ```
   Mixpanel:Get-Query-Schema(report_type='insights')
   ```
   This returns the complete JSON schema showing all available options

2. **Build your query using the schema:**
   - Use `breakdown` for segmentation by property
   - Use `filters` for event-level or global filtering
   - Use `comparison` for time period comparisons
   - Use `formula` for custom calculations
   - Check schema for exact property names and structure

3. **Run the query:**
   ```
   Mixpanel:Run-Query(
     project_id=X,
     report_type='insights',
     report={...full query following schema...}
   )
   ```

**Using skip_results:**
- Add `skip_results=true` if you only need the query_id (e.g., for dashboards)
- Omit or set to `false` if you want the actual data results

6. **Verify results** - check data makes sense

7. **Save to board (optional):**
   - If you used skip_results=true, you already have the query_id
   - Can be added to an existing or new board using Create-Dashboard

## Error Handling

**If query fails:**
- Read error message carefully
- Common issues: incorrect event names, invalid filters, wrong parameter types
- Fix query and retry
- Verify events exist via Get-Events first

**If zero results:**
- Check filters aren't too restrictive
- Verify event has data
- Try broader time range
- Check date format

## Best Practices

**Naming:**
- Include metric + time context: "Weekly Active Users Last 90 Days"
- Not: "WAU" or "Users"

**Time ranges:**
- Default to "Last 30 Days"
- Use specific dates for historical periods
- State interpreted range explicitly

**Verification:**
- Always verify event exists before using
- Check properties with Get-Property-Names
- Confirm values with Get-Property-Values

**Comparisons:**
- Use breakdowns for comparing user segments
- Use date comparisons for period-over-period

**Always include:**
- What the report shows
- Key insights from initial data
- Methodology used
